## Ideas
- Add a scale slider for modules
- Add different tile / module types? Add cube and hex options?
- Solar arrays, radiators, docking ports that snap to faces
- Procedural stations based on parameters
- - GUI component to live generate stations?
- Show control instructions in UImarkd
- Test / Implement basic VR support
- Improve the HUD. Allow buttons to be clickable.
- **Save/Load**: Serialize station configuration to JSON
- Screenshot / export images of stations
- Better face meshes for modules
- (Possible?) **Multiplayer**: Collaborative building
- **Interior View**: Enter modules, see internal structure


## Bugs
- What sizes are modules supposed to be?
- Don't allow placing models on Earth surface
- Try to prevent intersecting modules
